Programming for animation
Okay for real though I have no ide how thisall works. However, I am going to leave my comments here as I think I need to.

In this version I added the path and from path library. I did this so that the pathing for any file library format is going to be a problem.

A lot has been changed and to be honest I don't quite understand what I did entirely. But what I do know is that my code can now read a file name and what version it is. Which I'm guessing is what is going to help when it comes to the different updates that are constantly made during production.

With this version I did some really huge changes I managed to get maya import to work and worked out the pathlib so that the file can function in py 2.7

I can save files and also if we don't have a folder in the path directory it can create one.

Last version I did was to set up a incremental save so that the code will not write over exsiting files and save up to the latest version.
