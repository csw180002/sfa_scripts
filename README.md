# sfa_scripts
Programming for animation
Okay for real though I have no ide how thisall works. However, I am going to leave my comments here as I think I need to.

In this version I added the path and from path library. I did this so that the pathing for any file library format is going to be a problem.

A lot has been changed and to be honest I don't quite understand what I did entirely. But what I do know is that my code can now read a file name and what version it is. Which I'm guessing is what is going to help when it comes to the different updates that are constantly made during production.
